      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>•	I'm a Software Developer<br>
        •	I'm an entrepreneur<br>
        •	I'm detail oriented<br>
        •	I love things that work how they're supposed to<br><br>
        Think about the last time you went onto a website, any website. Was there anything that made you frustrated? Or anything that made you feel inconvenient? Was the webpage not the most attractive? What I aim to do with the website I am creating is making something that YOU WANT to be on and enjoy using. 
        Something that MAKES YOU keep going back on because it looks gorgeous. And something that will GIVE YOU the enjoyment YOU are looking for in a website.
        </p>



      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My goal here is to create a website, and eventually an app, that is based on one of Nintendo's most famous and popular games, “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild”. In this video game, there are these creatures called Korok's that are hidden all over the map. It is your job to find them. In return for finding them, they give you a seed that you can use later in-game. 
          What this website will allow you to do is to find the general location of these “Korok's” all over the world via geographic location, similar to geocaching. Your job is to go to these locations and find a QR code that has been placed by someone else previously, scan it, and then collect the rewards. Do you want to go on an adventure in search of these Korok's?

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Purpose of the Home Page:
	This home page is to basically show off what the app. It is going to look good and describe what and how the app will look. It is the intro to the app, so it may not be super detailed and specific of how it all works. But it will explain the purpose of it and just basically show it off. Promote it in a way. This page will also explain that this app is similar to Geocaching and allows you to actually find these little guys in the real world.
  <br><br>•	First Image Description: Image of a Korok<br>

o	Describe what a Korok is and the purpose of it in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and describe that they are hidden all over the world waiting for you to find and collect them all!<br><br>

•	Second Image Description: Image of a Korok and THE WORLD (idk yet)<br>

o	Describe that these little guys are hidden everywhere in your real world and that your goal and purpose is to travel the world in search of them<br>
o	Also explain that it is like geocaching.<br><br>

•	Third Image Description: Image of a Korok hiding in a room or something :)<br>

o	Describe how to find them and that you have to solve a little puzzle that is created to have him appear! <br><br>
(There are other images that I may or may not add. I will decide when it comes to it. )<br>

        <img class="screenshot_2" src="images/screenshot_2.png" alt="korok in flames">    <br>

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        Purpose of the First Child Page: How the App Works<br><br>
•	Show how the app is supposed to work with details about what mechanics that are built into it.<br>
•	Show what the person needs to do to find and collect the Korok<br><br>

This app in many cases is like geocaching. There are QR codes that are hidden around, and your job is to find them! You open the app up on your phone you view where there may be potential Korok's. 
When your location is nearby a potential Korok, you will receive a little notification with a sound that says “A Korok is nearby!” and then the hunt begins. You walk around with the sound getting louder when you get close, and quieter when you are farther away. When you find the location of the QR code, a scanner will pop up and then you scan the code. A video will play that says “Yahaha! You found me!” and then you will receive a little Korok seed that you can use later!<br>

      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Purpose of the Second Child Page: What you can earn or win! Or even a promoting page.<br><br>
•	Bring back the Korok seeds that you earn from finding them to Hestu who will give you rewards and prizes!<br><br>

Enjoy creating your own adventure with the help of Korok's!<br><br>

Still working on this page! :)<br>
